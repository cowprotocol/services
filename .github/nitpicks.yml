    Reminder: Please update the DB Readme and comment whether migrations are reversible (include rollback scripts if applicable).
    * If creating new tables, update the [tables list](https://github.com/cowprotocol/services/blob/main/crates/database/src/lib.rs#L51-L87).
    * When adding a new index, consider using `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` for tables involved in the critical execution path.
    * For the breaking changes, keep in mind that 2 autopilot instances will be running in parallel during deployment, so the change shouldn't cause panics in the previous autopilot version. As a workaround, first, update the code to support the change and only in the next release, apply the DB breaking changes.

    Reminder: Please consider backward compatibility when modifying the API specification. 
    If breaking changes are unavoidable, ensure:
    - You explicitly pointed out breaking changes.
    - You communicate the changes to affected teams (at least Frontend team and SAFE team).
    - You provide proper versioning and migration mechanisms.
