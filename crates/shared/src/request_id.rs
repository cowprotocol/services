//! This module supplies the tools to associate 1 identifier with a task.
//! That identifier is accessable globally just for that task. The idea
//! is that this identifier is supposed to tie together related logs. That
//! is easy to accomplish in a single process (simply use a tracing span)
//! but if you want to tie together logs across multiple processes things
//! can get messier.
//! The most obvious option is to take that identifier and pass that through
//! the process until you make some request to another process and give that
//! process the identifier in your request.
//! However, if would do that the identifier would basically show up everywhere
//! although other components don't care about it and it doesn't even change
//! any behaviour in the process.
//! Instead we use task local storage that is globally visible but only
//! individual to each task. That way we can populate the storage with the
//! identifier once and not care about dragging it through the code base.
//! And when we issue requests to another process we can simply fetch the
//! current identifier specific to our task and send that along with the
//! request.
