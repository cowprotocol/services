//! Contains event handling for maintaining in-memory storage of a
//!     `BalancerPoolRegistry` along with tools for retrieving known pools from
//!     this registry on demand.
//!
//! While the static information of the pools (such as `pool_id`, `address`,
//!     `tokens`) can be kept in memory as part of the registry, their dynamic
//!     information (such as current reserves) is block-dependent and must be
//!     queried from the EVM upon request.
//!
//! For this we provide `BalancerPoolFetcher` which is responsible for
//!     retrieving requested pools from the registry and attaching the most
//!     recent reserves to the result.
//!
//! The module is designed to return the most recent pool info on demand.
//! The only public facing components necessary to achieve this are:
//!
//! 1. `BalancerPoolRegistry` which contains an event handler for each distinct
//!    Balancer Pool Factory contract and maintains its own in-memory storage of
//!    each pool and its static information.
//!
//! 2. `BalancerPoolFetcher` which holds an instance of `BalancerPoolRegistry`,
//!    implements `WeightedPoolFetching` and thus exposes a `fetch` method which
//!    returns a collection of relevant `WeightedPools` for a given collection
//!    of `TokenPair`.
//!
//! 3. `WeightedPool` & `StablePool`: This is the public facing pool structure
//!    returned by the `PoolFetcher` consisting of all the pool's most recent
//!    information (both static and dynamic). Essentially, this is all the
//!    relevant data from `RegisteredWeightedPool` and `RegisteredStablePool`
//!    respectively along with the current balances of each of the pool's tokens
//!    (aka the pool's "reserves").
//!
//! For this reason, only the `event_handler`, `pool_cache`, `pool_fetching` and
//!     `swap` are declared as public, others merely contain internal logic
//!     regarding how information is collected and stored.
//!
//! Once should think of `PoolStorage` as a type of Database for which one is
//!     not concerned with how it maintains itself.
