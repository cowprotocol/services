        //    Note that we do want to delete events if the new events are empty while fetching was
        //    successful.
        // 2. It ensures that other users of the database are unlikely to see an inconsistent state
        //    some events have been deleted but new ones not yet inserted. This is important in case
        //    for example another part of the code calculates the total executed amount of an order.

        // MAX_REORG_BLOCK_COUNT in the database but then any code using trade events would have to
        // go through this class instead of being able to work with the database directly.
