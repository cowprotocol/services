//! This module is responsible for updating the database, for each settlement
//! event that is emitted by the settlement contract.
//
// Each settlement transaction is expected to contain an auction id to uniquely
// identify the auction for which it was allowed to be brought onchain.
// This auction id is used to build the accociation between the settlement event
// and the auction in the database.
//
// Another responsibility of this module is to observe the settlement and save
// data of interest to the database. This data includes surplus, taken fees, gas
// used etc.
