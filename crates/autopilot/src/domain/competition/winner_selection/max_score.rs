//! Winner Selection:
//! Simply picks the 1 solution with the highest overall score.
//!
//! Fairness Guarantees:
//! This winner selection does not have any inherent fairness guarantees for
//! individual orders. However, each order's execution is basically "insured" by
//! EBBO (ethereum best bid offer) - that is an order should get executed at
//! least as good as possible using very popular onchain liquidity sources. Each
//! solver can opt-in to have their solutions invalidated if the estimated total
//! EBBO violations would exceed a configurable threshold.
//!
//! Reference Score:
//! The reference score is simply the second highest reported score of all
//! solutions. If there is only 1 solution the reference score is 0.
