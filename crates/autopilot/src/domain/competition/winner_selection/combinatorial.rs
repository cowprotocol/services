//! Winner Selection:
//! Implements a winner selction algorithm which picks the **set** of solutions
//! which maximize surplus while enforcing uniform **directional** clearing
//! prices. That means all orders selling the same token must get executed at
//! the same price for that token. But orders buying that same token may all be
//! settled at a different (but still uniform) price. So effectively instead of
//! allowing only 1 price for each token (uniform clearing price) each token may
//! have 2 prices (one for selling it and another for buying it).
//!
//! Fairness Guarantees:
//! A solution is only valid if it does not settle any order at a worse uniform
//! directional clearing price than the best solution which only contains this
//! uniform directional clearing price. In other words an order may only be
//! batched with other orders if each order gets a better deal than executing
//! it individually.
//! Because these guarantees rely heavily on all relevant scores of each
//! solution being computed, we'll discard solutions where that computation
//! fails.
//!
//! Reference Score:
//! Each solver S with a winning solution gets one reference score. The
//! reference score is the total score of all winning solutions if the solver S
//! had not participated in the competition.
//! That is effectively a measurement of how much better each order got executed
//! because solver S participated in the competition.
