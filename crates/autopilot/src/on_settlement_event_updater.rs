//! This module is responsible for updating the database, for each settlement
//! event that is emitted by the settlement contract.
//
// Each settlement transaction is expected to contain an auction id to uniquely
// identify the auction for which it was allowed to be brought onchain.
// This auction id is used to build the accociation between the settlement event
// and the auction in the database.
//
// Building of this asscociation happens in an always running background task.
//
// Alternatively we could change the event insertion code to do this but I (vk)
// would like to keep that code as fast as possible to not slow down event
// insertion which also needs to deal with reorgs. It is also nicer from a code
// organization standpoint.

// Another responsibility of this module is to observe the settlement and save
// data of interest to the database. This data includes surplus, taken fees, gas
// used etc.
