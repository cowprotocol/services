///
/// - Liquidity orders can't be settled directly against on-chain liquidity.
///   They are meant to only be used in CoWs to facilitate the trading of other
///   non-liquidity orders.
/// - Liquidity orders do not provide any solver rewards.
///
/// As their name suggests, they are meant as a mechanism for providing
/// liquidity on CoW Protocol to other non-liquidity orders: they provide a
/// mechanism for turning one token into another. In this regard, a liquidity
/// order is conceptually similar to `liquidity::Liquidity`. One notable
/// difference between the two is in how they are executed. General liquidity
/// requires tokens up-front in order to exchange them for something else. On
/// the other hand, liquidity orders are CoW Protocol orders, meaning that they
/// first provide the tokens being swapped to and only get paid at the end of
