//! This is a very simple anti-corruption layer between the driver and the rest
//! of the codebase. The purpose of this layer is to give a very clear
//! indication of where and how the integration between the driver and the rest
//! of the code happens, and to serve as a line of defense against leaking
//! unnecessary details from that codebase into the driver.
//!
//! To quote a popular author:

//! > When a new system is being built that must have a large interface with
//! another, the difficulty of relating the two models can eventually overwhelm
//! the intent of the new model altogether, causing it to be modified to
//! resemble the other system's model, in an ad hoc fashion. The models of
//! legacy systems are usually weak, and even the exception that is well
//! developed may not fit the needs of the current project. Yet there may be a
//! lot of value in the integration, and sometimes it is an absolute
//! requirement. Therefore, the developer should create an isolating layer to
//! provide clients with functionality in terms of their own domain model. The
//! layer talks to the other system through its existing interface, requiring
//! little or no modification to the other system. Internally, the layer
//! translates in both directions as necessary between the two models.
