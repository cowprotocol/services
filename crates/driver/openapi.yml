        Solve the passed in auction.

        The response contains the objective value of the solution the Solver is able to find but not
        the calldata. This facilitates solvers that work with an RFQ system. When Autopilot decides
        the winner of the of the auction it prompts the corresponding solver to execute its solution
        through the execute endpoint.

        The Solver should respond quickly enough so that the caller of the endpoint receives the
        response within the deadline indicated in the request. This includes taking into account
        network delay.

        Autopilot will call this endpoint at most once for the same auction id and the following
        call will have a larger id.

    post:

        Reveal the details of the previously solved auction.

        Called by Autopilot if this Solver's solution is the winner of the competition. After reveal
        returns successfully Autopilot will call /execute.

        The auction that should be revealed is identified through its id and was recently returned
        by this Solver's solve endpoint.

        By accepting the reveal request the Solver promises that the solution can be executed on
        chain.

          The Solver knows how to fill the request with these parameters.

          If the request was of type `buy` then the response's buy amount has the same value as the
          request's amount and the sell amount was filled in by the server. Vice versa for type
          `sell`.

          This is not an error. The server handled the request correctly but could not create a
