          Successful Quote

          The Solver knows how to fill the request with these parameters.

          If the request was of type `buy` then the response's buy amount has the same value as the
          request's amount and the sell amount was filled in by the server. Vice versa for type
          `sell`.
        type: object
        properties:
          sellAmount:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/TokenAmount"
          buyAmount:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/TokenAmount"

          Unfillable Quote

          This is not an error. The server handled the request correctly but could not create a
          quote. For example, this Solver might not be aware of any liquidity between the tokens.
