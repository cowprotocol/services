# CoW Playground 

The ultimate goal is to have a single command that will spin up a local CoW network, with all the components needed to run the CoW Protocol stack üöÄ

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repo.
2. It is expected that this is from from a `devcontainer` in VSCode, or a similar environment.
3. Configure the stack by editing the `.env.example` file and renaming it to `.env`. **NOTE**: RPC demand is very high, for optimal performance, use a local node. The stack was tested with `reth` on `mainnet`.
4. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml up -d`.
5. Configure Rabby Wallet (or see [metamask specific notes](#metamask)) to use the RPC endpoint at `http://localhost:8545` (for `mainnet`, or your network of choice).
6. Configure your wallet to use a test account (any of the first 10 accounts from the test mnemonic will do).

**NOTE**: By default, `anvil` will set the balances of the first 10 accounts to 10000 ETH. The wallet configuration is:

```
Mnemonic:           test test test test test test test test test test test junk
Derivation path:    m/44'/60'/0'/0/

```

Now with Rabby configured, and the services started, you can browse to http://localhost:8000 and make a trade with CoW Swap. Initially you will start with 10000 ETH, so you will have to wrap some ETH, or alternatively just simply test out an EthFlow order! You can follow along with watching the logs of the `autopilot`, `driver`, and `baseline` solver to see how the Protocol interacts.

### Resetting the playground

Resetting the playground involves resetting the state for both the containers, but _also_ resetting the state for your wallet! Failure to do this may result in unexpected behaviour due to `nonce` issues:

1. Remove the containers and volumes with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes`.
2. Reset your wallet:
   a. For Rabby, select "Clear pending" from the "More" section of the wallet.
   b. For Metamask, follow [these instructions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account) to reset your account.

### Try another network

Woah! You're quick. You've already got the CoW stack running on `mainnet`! But what if you want to try another network? No problem!

1. Change the `ETH_RPC_URL` in the `.env` file to the network of your choice.
2. Reset the stack by removing the containers and volumes with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes`.
3. Start the stack again with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.fork.yml up -d`.

## Web3 wallets

### Rabby

Rabby is a web3 wallet and has some nice features for interacting with the CoW Protocol.
It's suggested to use this wallet for the best experience.
When interacting with the CoW Swap UI, just select Metamask when connecting a wallet, and this will use the Rabby wallet.

### Metamask

Metamask is popular, and unfortunately Rabby isn't available on Firefox.
Also, unfortunately Metamask take a very strong stance on not allowing you change the RPC endpoint for `mainnet` within the user interface.
Let's use some skills to get around this!
Open up your browser's developer console, and run the following:

```javascript
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
  params: [
    {
      chainId: '0x1',
      chainName: 'Local Network (Mainnet)',
      rpcUrls: ['http://localhost:8545'],
      nativeCurrency: {
        name: "Ethereum",
        symbol: "ETH",
        decimals: 18,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
