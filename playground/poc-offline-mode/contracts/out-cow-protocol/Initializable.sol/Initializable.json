Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/lib/contracts/src/contracts/mixins/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000000},\"remappings\":[\":@cowprotocol/=contracts/lib/cow-protocol-contracts/src/contracts/\",\":@openzeppelin/=contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\",\":@uniswap/v2-core/=contracts/lib/v2-core/\",\":@uniswap/v2-periphery/=contracts/lib/v2-periphery/\",\":forge-std/=contracts/lib/forge-std/src/\",\":solmate/=contracts/lib/solmate/src/\"]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/lib/contracts/src/contracts/mixins/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xab11dad416217a7515e1634fa04904a4d32d10e6584e25b2e962b3f6b8a5abed\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://31976212e1bb300bfe6efd18aef1749deb53885d9e7ae0c2c7e680ef96381d39\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfBixsQthmXCXH1zaYiYBBkXre5iGy7vP4T2e731HrgNB\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.7.6+commit.7338295f"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@cowprotocol/=contracts/lib/cow-protocol-contracts/src/contracts/","@openzeppelin/=contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","@uniswap/v2-core/=contracts/lib/v2-core/","@uniswap/v2-periphery/=contracts/lib/v2-periphery/","forge-std/=contracts/lib/forge-std/src/","solmate/=contracts/lib/solmate/src/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":1000000},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"contracts/lib/contracts/src/contracts/mixins/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{}},"sources":{"contracts/lib/contracts/src/contracts/mixins/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0xab11dad416217a7515e1634fa04904a4d32d10e6584e25b2e962b3f6b8a5abed","urls":["bzz-raw://31976212e1bb300bfe6efd18aef1749deb53885d9e7ae0c2c7e680ef96381d39","dweb:/ipfs/QmfBixsQthmXCXH1zaYiYBBkXre5iGy7vP4T2e731HrgNB"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":16}
